# An ongoing personal site project
This repo containts the HTML pages that I'm hosting using the nodejs/express [server](https://github.com/wwmairs/server "a rather simple server") that I've been putting together.  
It's mostly just a little playground to work out APIs, like the super cool [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net) API. 

### TODO
- [x] serve static content
- [x] figure out how to use darksky api (thanks to a neat [wrapper](https://github.com/soplakanets/node-forecastio))
- [x] implement client-side use of weather.json route
- [x] make a sun using p5.js
- [ ] animate cloud cover again
- [ ] more interactive design using the Dark Sky data
- [ ] fix resizing on where.html
- [ ] some kinda mobile features on where.html (can you scroll?)
- [ ] make weather.json actually secure
- [ ] get google email back up on contact.html
- [ ] more things!
