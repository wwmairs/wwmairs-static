			<h1>BUENOS AIRES</h1>

			<p>On the northern edge of the city, just above Palermo, there are a few beautiful gardens.  We visited the Jard&iacute;n Japon&eacute;s, constructed in the 60s to welcome the prince on his trip to Argentina.  Weaving between school-kids on fields trips and taller people with cameras we walked around its ponds and bridges and ate fried-chicken.</p>

			<p>South of the Plaza de Mayo is la Boca, a neighborhood home to one of the city's two footbal stadiums (described in a guide book as 'strikingly ugly both from a distance and up close'), and city blocks stuffed with housed painted in haphazard rainbow.  We were told that the tradition of bright colors started when painters looking to save a buck simply bought whatever color what cheapest, even if it didn't match the section of the wall they'd painted the day before.</p>
			<p>The area draws a lot of attention, particularly from those looking for a flashy photo or a tango-themed fridge magnet to document their trip to Buenos Aires.  The streets are full of errant travelers and the meat-smoke air of roadside parillas</p>

			<p>Close to the Jard&iacute;n Japon&eacute;s is the Jard&iacute;n Bot&aacute;nico, a spcacious and very well-labeled public park.  We tried to find the section of Yerba Mate they cultivate there, but couldn't.  I  was very enamored by the field of wobbly cacti.</p>

			<p>Outside of the city, at the end of one of the municipal rail lines, is a vacation-y town called Tigre.  It sits on the river delta and is cut up into islands by the water.  Along all the banks of the river are sleepy houses on stilts, accesible only by boat.</p>
			<p>The largest of these islands hosts the Puerto de Frutos, a market built up on the piers selling, in addition to fruits, lamps, home decor, cheese and sausages, the ever-present gaucho knives, cutting boards, and lots of wooden furniture.  It seemed entire neighborhoods of the city had all driven out here to buy a cutting board and dresser before driving home.  We were glad to have taken the train.</p>

			<p>Today we sat in a cafe and watched soccer, surrounded by raucous Argentines exalting the national team's having just barely made it to the elimination round of the copa.  They're hanging on by a thread, but it's exciting to be surrounded by so much energy.</p>
