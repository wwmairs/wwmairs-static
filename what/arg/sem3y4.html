			<h1>BUENOS AIRES</h1>
			<h3>Recoleta, Retiro, Montevideo, &amp; ferias.</h3>

			<p>Last week we were joined by two of my friends from high school, who happened to find their way to Argentina while blowing off the early summer before they begin their jobs.  The busyness threw off my schedule, but I still got some good photos from the last two weeks.</p>
			<p>Before the other two arrived, we spent time exploring more of Retiro and Recoleta, two neighborhoods on the Northern edge of the city.  We visited <i>floralis gen&eacute;rica</i>, an enomous, shiny, metal flower gifted to the city by porte&ntilde;o architect Eduardo Catalano, the fellow who designed Lincoln Center (among a great many other interesting things).  Every morning at 8am the flower opens its petals, closing them again at sunset, or if it's somewhat windy, as it was the day we visited.</p>

			<p>From there we went to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, a lovely pink-colored building with imposing greco-roman columns out front.  I was particularly interested in a large installation they had on the Manufacture de Gobelins, a centuries-old french tapestry factory beloved by both Louis XIV and Joan Mir&oacute;.  While the old tapestries on display were full mostly of babies with wings and knights and such, the modern and contemporary tapestries were spectacular, full of bright colors and shapes.</p>

			<p>Walking aroung the city I find myself unsure of what to look at, caught between the buildings, the people, and the sky.</p>

			<p>Once the others arrived, we found ourselves in the Recoleta Cemetery again.  Eva Per&oacute;n's tomb had fewer notes than the first time we saw it, but more flowers.  Being in the cemetery a second time, I found the spookiness giving way to a clearer view of its beauty, order, and peace.  Walking past broken marble doors and exposed caskets still makes me jump, though.</p>

			<p>Just across the R&iacute;o de la Plata is Uruguay and the city of Montevideo.  We took a very fast boat (107 km/h!) named Francis (after the pope, the Argentines are very proud of him) and went on a quick trip to Montevideo.</p>
			<p>We had a quiet moment paying respects to Jos&eacute; Artigas, an Uruguayan national hero with a spectacular, grand, and beautiful tomb, complete with posed soldiers in fancy hats.</p>

			<p>Visiting the various ferias that pop up around the city on Sundays has become a weekly adventure.  The two newcomers took us back to San Telmo, and we spent another day weaving between tourists and people pushing empanadas and dulce de leche.</p>

			<p>We always seem to find our way to choripan around lunchtime.</p>

			<p>Now all the others have left, and it's just me and Avery and this big city.  We're still deciding what to do with the time that's left to us.</p>
