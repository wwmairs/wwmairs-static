            <p>Working full-stack at Only Sky, I worked on <a href="https://wp.theonlysky.com/atmosphere/">OS Atmosphere</a>, an online booking service for bespoke guided experiences at Winter Park.  Using flask, sqlalchemy, jinja, jquery, and sass, I built out the guide search page, ecommerce flow, and integrated the whole thing with Stripe for payments and Only Sky's scheduling platform.

			<h3><a name="modules" href="https://wwmairs.github.io/modules/">modules</a></h3>
			<p>Expanding off the visual synth, I've been working on a modular, client-side, web audio-based synthesizer app abstracted into custom HTML elements.  Different sequencers and controllers mix-and-match with synth-engines, built on top of a library of modular synthesis classes.  Check out the <a href="https://wwmairs.github.io/modules/">work in progress</a> or <a href="https://github.com/wwmairs/modules/">clone the repo</a> to build your own instruments or help me make something new.

        <p>Diving into generative music and the ancient math of rhythms, I learned about Euclidean rhythms and how to generate them with an algorithm named Bjorklund.  I made a <a href="bjorklund.html">simple tool</a> that makes it easy to generate and play with Euclidean rhythms.

        <p>Synthesizers and electronic instruments are fun, and the web audio API is incredibly powerful tool to create your own.  My friend <a href="https://github.com/jacoblurye">Jacob</a> and I have been building a funky little <a href="visual-synth/">sequencer</a>.  Oscillator tone circles are dragged into one of eight steps and horizontal position determines the frequency of the oscillator.  Dual modulators are tied to each oscillator, with a simple lowpass to round things out.</p>

This is both a grand ole time and an excellent source of (more or less) insteresting data to visualize.  Check out <a href="games">what I've done</a> and how we've played.</p>
