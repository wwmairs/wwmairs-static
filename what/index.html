        <h3><a name="bjorklunder" href="bjorklund.html">BJORKLUNDER</a></h3>
        <p>Diving into generative music and the ancient math of rhythms, I learned about Euclidean rhythms and how to generate them with an algorithm named Bjorklund.  I made a <a href="bjorklund.html">simple tool</a> that makes it easy to generate and play with Euclidean rhythms.

        <h3><a name="visual-synth" href="visual-synth/">VISUAL SYNTH</a></h3>
        <p>Synthesizers and electronic instruments are fun, and the web audio API is incredibly powerful tool to create your own.  My friend <a href="https://github.com/jacoblurye">Jacob</a> and I have been building a funky little <a href="visual-synth/">sequencer</a>.  Oscillator tone circles are dragged into one of eight steps and horizontal position determines the frequency of the oscillator.  Dual modulators are tied to each oscillator, with a simple lowpass to round things out.</p>

        <p>Sarah is a bookbinder based out of Somerville, MA.  She's about to finish her certification at the North Bennett Street School.  I made a website for her, which you can check out <a href="http://wwmairs.github.io/skim">here</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="gundeath" href="/gun_death">GUN DEATH IN AMERICA</a></h3>
        <p>I've been struggling lately with the state of guns, gun ownership, and gun violence in this country.  For a project on the theme of "viz for good", my friend Katya and I built <a href="/gun_death">this visualization</a> examining the effect that the rate of suicide has when comparing rates of gun death accross different countries.</p>

        <p>My friends and I have been known to get pretty obsessive with our games (right now it's mostly Hearts, Big Two, and Yahtzee), logging scores for months.  This is both a grand ole time and an excellent source of (more or less) insteresting data to visualize.  Check out <a href="games">what I've done</a> and how we've played.</p>

        <p>Cloe needed a lightweight, minimal site to showcase her work, an unobtrusive look and clean typefaces to let her photography take control.  <a href="http://cloeyoung.com">See her work</a> and read more about what she's up to.</p>

	  		<p><a href="http://averyspratt.com">Avery</a> and I collaborated on a project to transform a plain, white duvet cover.  Equal parts geometry and whimsy took over, and we wound up with a <a href="duvet.html">one-of-a-kind</a>, functional piece that'll keep you warm and smiling at night.</p>

        <p>We've been playing a lot of yahtzee lately, but we ran out of the little, pre-printed score sheets.  I designed my own yahtzee booklets, which you can <a href="yahtzee_card.pdf">download</a>, fold, staple (or sticth), and cut to make your own.</p>
