                hula hoops with quick twists,<br>
                fire dancers dancing unlit<br>
                practicing,<br>
                gesturing at luminence.
            </p>
            <p>
                two old couples lock step<br>
                in split rows, first the husbands,<br>
                ball-capped, sun-glassed,<br>
                hands jammed in blue jeans,<br>
                missing lassos and new ash,<br>
                then wives, hands folded,<br>
                matching-bloused, they stop walking,<br>
                turning to the other, fall silent,<br>
                look briefly, walk again.
            </p>
            <p>
                legs, dogs,<br>
                bicycles,<br>

            <p>
                the base of an oak,<br>
                still unleaved, flush with<br>
                dandelions and<br>
                the sun that they've got still.<br>
                this they're permitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                and I, I in the grass<br>
                matting patches all splayed,<br>
                I write as still caught<br>
                in the blade-by-blade beauty,<br>
                tremorous and unconcerned,<br>
                of the grass shimmering,<br>

                we strip ourselves again,<br>
                cling to stones and bare ankles,<br>
                lastly reach<br>
                to touch fingertips and find<br>
                the distance just an armslength.

                you and I<br>
                two points twisting in the starlight.
