                    are you now the oak tree,<br>
                    the one grown not from acorn<br>
                    but a sapling you stole<br>
                    from down the road,<br>
                    dug up, then planted by the shed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    you watched it get tall and<br>
                    thick with pointy leaves and<br>
                    I still wince in summertime<br>
                    when my bare feet land on<br>
                    an acorn fallen in the grass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    or are you now the knobbled apple<br>
                    that gives its shade for august naps<br>
                    and whose windfall fruit shared<br>
                    their last summer with you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    or the black walnut<br>
                    with its little stones that<br>
                    stink of bitter earth and july<br>
                    and stain everything they touch?
                </p>
                <p>

                    these bananas<br>
                    are too green.

                    I'm sure they've<br>
                    seen a lot,<br>
                    being so well-traveled<br>
                    and all.<br>
                    But they<br>
                    are too green

                <p>
                    I knew this<br>
                    seeing them<br>
                    there on the shelf<br>
                    looking birght,<br>
                    undisqualified:<br>
                    I wanted bananas.

                    now unfairly<br>

                    whose fault<br>
                    is this?

                <p>
                    if I weren't<br>
                    so hungry<br>
                    they might<br>

                    I read a letter<br>
                    never sent<br>
                    old<br>
                    it'd be crumpled too<br>
                    but it's all digital<br>
                    black, white, and blue<br>
                    and if I wanted<br>
                    I could make it blink<br>
                    like it were<br>
                    all fresh again<br>
                    and I'd say<br>
                    that I'll just<br>
                    check the spelling<br>
                    and send it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    it's not to say<br>
                    I haven't thought<br>
                    of you &mdash; only<br>
                    that the train<br>
                    was too damn crowded<br>
                    and I wished<br>
                    you'd wanted<br>
                    to come downtown<br>
                    for me.

                    we'll go and find some flat place<br>
                    between the mountains and a creek<br>
                    snaking simple through the grasses<br>

                    listening to the frost capped grass whispers<br>
